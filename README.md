However, it's likely to be useful to others as well. <br/>*(Description taken from the module repo)*|

## :question: How to submit your own entry(ies)?
There is two ways to submit an entry.

1. If a project already exists elsewhere or you want to work in your own side, you can simply edit the `README` to add the relevant informations and links in the tables above (feel free to copy the `README` template if needed) ; 
2. Fork this repo, create a folder with you username, do your magic, do a pull request and edit the `README` with the relevant informations and links.

## Minimal requirements
The minimum requirements for a submission is to have the following features :

* Add / delete a TODO item.
* Mark an item as DONE.
* Show the full list of entries

That's it, that's all! 

If you want to add anymore functionalities, please do as you wish!
You want to provide CLI app, GUI app, Web todo manager powered by Cro, limit is the space.

A minimal example is provided with [minimal](/notagoodidea/minimal/).
## Templates and stuff

The `template-LICENSE` contains the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/). You can copy and rename it as you wish or use the license of you choice.

The `template-README.md` contains a pre-filled README with a few blank to leave. Using this template is optional but if you decide to provide your own please be sure to provide similar informations.

## Todos?
Yep a bad wordplay with the plural of todo and the todos word in Spanish meaning everything. Deal with it :)
