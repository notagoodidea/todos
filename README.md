# todos - A collection of Raku Todo list apps
The todo list manager is almost a meme when showcasing the ability of a programming language or framework.
The idea behind **todos** is collect from any participants todo app with a set of minimum requirements:

* Add / Delete a TODO
* Mark a TODO as DONE
* Show the full list of entries

Based on those essentials, your app can provide anything on top of that you want : CLI management, web interface, saved as one/ten files or a database, it is up to you.

To provide a pull request : under a folder with your username, provide a completed `README.md` (see the template `README-template.md`), a license of your choice (the `LICENCE-template.md` is *The Unlicence*).
